# What is Split-Horizon DNS?

In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking),
**split-horizon DNS** (also known as **split-view DNS**, **split-brain
DNS**, or **split DNS**) is the facility of a [Domain Name
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) implementation to provide
different sets of DNS information, usually selected by the source
address of the DNS request.

This facility can provide a mechanism for security and privacy
management by logical or physical separation of DNS information for
network-internal access (within an [administrative
domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_domain), e.g., company) and access
from an unsecure, public network (e.g. the
[Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)).

Implementation of split-horizon DNS can be accomplished with
hardware-based separation or by software solutions. Hardware-based
implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access
granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either
multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server
software with the built-in capability of discriminating access to [DNS
zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone) records. The latter is a common feature of
many server software implementations of the DNS protocol (cf.
[Comparison of DNS server
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_server_software)) and is
sometimes the implied meaning of the term *split-horizon DNS*, since all
other forms of implementation can be achieved with any DNS server
software.

## Rationale

Split-horizon DNS can provide a mechanism for security and privacy
management by logical or physical separation of DNS information for
network-internal access (within an [administrative
domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_domain), e.g., company) and access
from an unsecure, public network (e.g. the
[Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)).

One common use case for split-horizon DNS is when a server has both a
private IP address on a local area network (not reachable from most of
the Internet) and a public address, i.e. an address reachable across the
Internet in general. By using split-horizon DNS the same name can lead
to either the private IP address or the public one, depending on which
client sends the query. This allows for critical local client machines
to access a server directly through the local network, without the need
to pass through a router. Passing through fewer network devices improves
the network latency.

As an example, the DNS server could be configured to return two
different sets of records for the host *host1.example.net* for
requestees internal and external to a corporate network. The internal
response could look like:

```
@       IN SOA  ns.example.net admin.example.net. (
                                2010010101      ; serial
                                        1D      ; refresh
                                        1H      ; retry
                                        1W      ; expire
                                        3H )    ; minimum
@       IN      NS              ns
ns      IN      A               203.0.113.2
host1   IN      A               10.0.0.10
```
While the external response would be:
```
@       IN SOA  ns.example.net admin.example.net. (
                                2010010101      ; serial
                                        1D      ; refresh
                                        1H      ; retry
                                        1W      ; expire
                                        3H )    ; minimum
@       IN      NS              ns
ns      IN      A               203.0.113.2
host1   IN      A               203.0.113.10
```

## Interaction with DNSSEC

Split-horizon DNS is designed to provide different authoritative answers
to an identical query and [DNSSEC](DNSSEC "wikilink") is used to ensure
veracity of data returned by the Domain Name System. These apparently
conflicting goals create the potential for confusion or false security
alerts in poorly constructed networks. Research has produced
recommendations to properly combine these two DNS features. [\[1\]](#cite-note-1)

## Implementations

hardware-based separation or by software solutions. Hardware-based
implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access
granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either
